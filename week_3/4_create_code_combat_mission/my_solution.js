// I worked by myself on this challenge

// Your mission description:
//  This mission is to sneak up on the munchkin without him noticing, then attack the munchkin and do a victory dance.  
//  The munchkin will be patrolling the hallway, don't get caught!
// 

// Pseudocode
// 
// We will define variables to create a hero and a munchkin. 
// The variables will include values that indicate the position of the vaiable to be displayed on the screen.
// The user will need to input direction to the hero variable to allow the hero to change position on the sreen.
// We will define functions to support the movement and actiona of the variables.
// We will need seperate functions for movement on both the x and y access, along with the actions to attack and dance.
// We will need to compare the variables positions and actions to determine if the user was successful.
// We will need to display to the user the outcome of the mission.
