* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?  The DOM is great tool that allows for you to change code in real time to not just check for errors, but to optimize your code as well.  I could see it being potentially being a crutch however if used to much.  Someone who doesn't fully understand how to write the code could update through trial and error and never really learn anything in the process.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?  I can see that I still have a LOT to learn...

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?  I found it found to tweak the code and see the results, its a little frustrating if you don't do something the correct way, but it's certainly satisfying once you figure out what you did wrong and fix it correctly!

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?  Modifiying the hover was really giving me trouble at first and I had to review the instructions multiple times before I finally figured it out.  I think my aha moment was realizing that I had coded correctly but code school's site wasn't picking it up.  Still working on why this wasn't pushing through, but I'll figure it out!

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.  Going through the other exercises on code school left me baffled when the discussion went to jquery coding.  Google helped me out quite a bit with that.  However, I was doing this from a different computer and didn't save the websites that I was looking at for clarification, I will be sure to do so in the future.
