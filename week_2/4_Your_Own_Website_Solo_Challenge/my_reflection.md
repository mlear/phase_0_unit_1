# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://mlear.github.io/

Wheeeeeew, that was a long couple of days.  Completely transformed my website from basic links with no styling to something a bit more complex.  If my wife would let me, I would sit here all night writing and testing code, loving this!

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

That there really is no right answer to either.  There are guidelies to follow of course, but in the end, its what you make of it!

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

Yes and no, it was fun customizing the website, but certainly grew frustrating at times when the things that I wanted to do, didn't turn out the way they looked in my head.  I'm sure a lot of that has to do with experiance and with practice and in the future most of this will be automatic.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I started with reviewing some of the material provided, did a quick wireframe to figure out a basic design, and then dove into coding.  I wanted to push myself to learn new things and looked at a lot of different websites for ideas.  I had a lot of trouble at first with the pseudocode, but after reviewing my best friend google, figured out what I was doing wrong.  The main issue that was giving me trouble was on my image links.  I wanted them to transform on the hover, and orginally I had but the link image directly into the html code.  This made it nearly impossible to allow me to alter it with the css.  After research, trial, and error, I figured out that I could actually set the link as a class, and altering that class was simple!  I like the results so far, and it leaves me with a lot of options for redesign in the future when needed.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I really need to work on my navigation bar, the presentation of the font and sizing, and the static background.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Beyond the normal difficulties of learning new code, it was mostly simple mistakes that I thought would work, but didn't.  A lot of the concepts that we are learning, like positioning, margins, padding, etc. where definitly solidfied through the coding here, and I am absolutley in love with the options pseduo code gives me.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

As I have stated in the past, w3schools.com has been helping greatly.
