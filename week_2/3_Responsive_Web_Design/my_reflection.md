# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?  

    Responsive web design is desiging a site to be available to essentially everyone who tries to view it.  Whether they are disabled, using a tablet, or a desktop, they will be able to view/hear your content.  It is a good practive to build a website from the ground up in this matter as it will be more readily available to your audiance.  No one wants to look at webpage designed for an hd monitor on a smartphone, it would be impossible.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?  

    Smartphones and tablets have forced designers to rethink how they code becuase you can no longer just program in a single size.  They know have to be aware that on any given day, a person looking at their site could have 3 different devices trying to view it, and it needs to be accesible by all or that person will get frustrated and move on.
    
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

    Of course we should, and with page readers we can.  The interent has become compeltely integrated into our lives, and it's shocking if I don't use it at least once per day.  Normally, the first thing I do in the morning is hit the sleep button on my iPhone to check for any texts or pushs from the night, and then unlock it to check for emails.  We can't keep this from the visually imparied.  One needs to develop their contact with this in mind to try and make their website as friendly as possible to page readers.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

    I'm still not 100% on the scaling to all of the different devices with meta tags.. but I will not give up this!  I did the tutorial and it made sense, but that can't be the whole picture, there is something else that I am not seeing.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

    I have been consistently been referring to W3Schools.com for syntax and reminders on flow.
