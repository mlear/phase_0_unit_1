# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?  They are good, or else developers would go rogue and ruin it for everyone else.  Its nice to have a standard to work off of as third parties can depend on how code will be written and develop their products accordingly.  Having to use a certain browser or device to be able to read a certain page would be a nightmare.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?  To the extent that I know of it, yes, I still have a lot of learning to do however.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?  I actually find them a bit excessive and like the DIV system better.  I'm sure as I use the new elements more I will quickly learn to love them though.
* 
* Why is reset.css necessary? When you are coding a page to be viewed on mulitple different platforms or browsers, you don't want you settings to default to the browser's settings, you want your own baseline for your page.
*
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do? In the past I have used Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE, Safari, Netscape, and I am sure I am missing a few.  I have noticed, more in the past than recently, that opening a site in one browser would result in a difference than another browser.  I think its great that developers can achieve this however, it provides alternatives for people.  However, i can see how it would be really frustrating for the web developer.
