    <h1><center>An Intro To Paired Programming:  Brought to you by <em>Jacky</em> and <em>Martin!</em></center></h1>
    
      <p>
       Paired programming is a great tool to use for those learning to code and for experienced programmes.  It provides a technique for quick error checking and allows for instruction when someone
       has met a challenge they couldn't complete.  As all of the new cohorts have seen in the first week of their introduction to DBC, our google plus community has been flooded
       with questions regarding code, syntax, general usage questions and other that could have quickly been answered if we were paired with another person we could brainstorm with.
       It also provides us practice for real world use once DBC upgrades us all into professional coders and releases us upon the world.

            <dd>This is a great tool to use for remote paired progamming.  It allows an unlimited amount of programmers to review and amend a program code at the same time.</dd>

        <dt>Google Hangouts</dt>
            <dd>Google hangouts is a great way to communicate from a distance.  It allows video conferencing to permit face to face communication, and also allows the individual
              members to share their screen to the rest of the conference.  There is a group chat on the side to offer comments along with option to take snapshots of video
              being shared.  Google drive will also allow those in conference to share data directly to each other

            <dd>
              Driving during paired programming means that you are the one who is responsible for laying down the code and taking direction for the Navigator.  Generally
              the drivers are those who are better at the code syntax (except in learning phase).

          <dt>Navigating</dt>
            <dd>
              Navigators lead the programming by telling the Drivers what to code and start the discussion about the different aspects of what is being coded itself.  By not
              having to type, it allows for the navigator to brainstorm for the pair.
